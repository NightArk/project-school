                         As their owner, you might find them constantly following you around and demanding your attention.
                          Siamese cats are notoriously vocal and noisy.
                           Due to their loud, low-pitched voice, they're often fondly called "meezers".</p>

                    <p class="expandable">The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face.
                    The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail.
                    The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.

                    <p class="expandable">The Siberian is a centuries-old landrace (natural variety) of domestic cat in Russia.
                    recently developed as a formal breed with standards promulgated the world over since the late-1980s.
                    Since 2006, the breed is recognised for registry and championship status with all major cat registries.
                    The formal name of the breed is Siberian Forest Cat, but it is typically referred to as the Siberian or Siberian cat.
                    Formerly, sometimes the names Moscow Semi-Longhair and Russian Longhair were also used.</p>

                        Reportedly established from three "drain cats" imported from Singapore in the 1970s,
                        it was later revealed that the cats were originally sent to Singapore from the United States before being exported back to the US.</p>

                    <p class="expandable">The Persian cat, also known as the Persian longhair, is a long-haired breed of cat characterised by a round face and short muzzle.
                        The first documented ancestors of Persian cats might have been imported into Italy from Khorasan as early as around 1620, however, this has not been proven.
                        Instead, there is stronger evidence for a longhaired cat breed being exported from Afghanistan and Iran from the 19th century onwards.</p>
