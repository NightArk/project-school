                <h1>Home Page</h1>
                <p>
                    Initially, our team grappled with conflicting ideas for the homepage design. One proposed a complex
                    layout, challenging to implement across subtopic pages, while another suggested a simpler, modern
                    design. Resolving this, we prioritized functionality and consistency. We chose the simpler design,
                    aligning with contemporary standards and ensuring seamless integration across pages. This decision
                    emphasized the importance of cohesive design and taught us to prioritize practicality without
                    compromising aesthetic appeal.</p>
                <h1>Scripting and Registration errors</h1>
                <p>
                    Upon publishing three subtopic pages for student continuation, an obstacle emerged during the
                    integration of registered usernames/first names into the navigation bar. Initially, we attempted to
                    incorporate the function within a script on each HTML page. However, a significant issue surfaced:
                    the called-out name didn't align with the navigation list in the CSS file. Consequently, the
                    displayed names appeared as unstyled text, devoid of any design. This persistent challenge prompted
                    a critical reevaluation of our strategy. We aimed to find a solution that would seamlessly integrate
                    and stylize the usernames/first names within the navigation bar. Our focus shifted toward exploring
                    alternative methods to ensure a cohesive design across all pages. This hurdle underscored the
                    importance of meticulous coding and design alignment, emphasizing the need for a robust integration
                    strategy to maintain consistency and aesthetic appeal throughout the website.</p>

            <div class="content-story">
                <h2>Group meetings</h2>
                <p>In dividing our work, we allocated each subtopic to a different student. Throughout the webpage
                    creation, we orchestrated regular group meetings to review and discuss individual progress, ensuring
                    all tasks were completed. These meetings convened twice a week on campus, dedicating each week to a
                    specific page. Once a page was finished, attention shifted to another student's page, fostering a
                    collaborative work dynamic. Additionally, beyond these scheduled meetings, we established an open
                    communication channel. Whenever a student encountered a problem with their work, an immediate online
                    call was initiated, gathering the team to troubleshoot and assist in rectifying script or page
                    issues. This proactive approach ensured swift resolution of individual challenges, maintaining the
                    project's momentum and preventing roadblocks from impeding progress. The combination of structured
                    group meetings for collective progress assessment and impromptu online calls for immediate issue
                    resolution fostered a supportive and efficient work environment, promoting both individual
                    responsibility and team collaboration in successfully navigating the intricacies of webpage
                    creation.</p>
                <h2>Solving problems</h2>
                <p>
                    When a student faced coding issues without real-time help, our team employed a collaborative
                    solution. The troubled student shared their HTML/CSS/JavaScript file in our group chat. This allowed
                    the next team member to review the code at their convenience, identifying errors and suggesting
                    improvements. This practice fostered ongoing learning, encouraging knowledge sharing and skill
                    enhancement. Each reviewer not only fixed immediate issues but also provided suggestions for better
                    coding practices. This collective effort enriched our understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                    fostering a supportive environment for skill development and knowledge exchange.</p>

                <h3>Functionality</h3>
                <p>Through our group collaboration in this project, we gained valuable insights into proficient web page
                    design. We learned to adeptly link scripts within pages, enhancing functionality for both
                    scriptwriters and page browsers. This experience honed our skills in crafting pages that seamlessly
                    integrate scripts, optimizing functionality and user experience. It provided us with multifaceted
                    approaches to elevate scripting techniques, ultimately enhancing the browsing experience while
                    reinforcing our understanding of effective webpage design.</p>
                <h3>Excecises</h3>
                <p>
                    In our learning process, we've discovered the art of constructing functional websites sans scripts
                    in certain scenarios. Simultaneously, we've delved into data preservation techniques, establishing
                    pathways to interlink this data, employing tools like "SessionStorage." Additionally, we've grasped
                    the significance of loading functions, strategically implementing them during website launches. This
                    experience showcased the versatility of building websites, from script-free functionalities to
                    managing and correlating data through storage methods like "SessionStorage." Moreover, integrating
                    loading functions at the website's initiation emerged as a pivotal strategy, underscoring our
                    comprehension of optimizing user experiences through efficient loading processes.</p>
